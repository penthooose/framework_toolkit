# Dataset Building Module

## Overview

This module provides specialized utilities for constructing instruction-following datasets in JSONL format for fine-tuning language models. **This implementation is highly customized for a specific application currently in development** and is provided as an implementation example rather than a general-purpose library.

## Purpose

The Dataset Building module focuses on:

1. Transforming prepared data into structured instruction-response pairs
2. Formatting these pairs into JSONL files suitable for fine-tuning language models
3. Providing template management for various instruction formats
4. Supporting data validation and quality assurance

## Implementation Example

While this module is tailored to specific application needs, it demonstrates practical approaches to:

- Converting raw data into fine-tuning datasets
- Creating effective instruction-following examples
- Managing template variations for different instruction types
- Implementing quality checks and validation logic

## JSONL Format

The generated JSONL files follow this structure:

```json
{"input": "Answer the following question about climate change: What are the main causes of global warming?", "output": "The main causes of global warming include greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices. These activities release carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere."}
{"input": "Based on your knowledge of psychology, respond to: How does confirmation bias affect decision making?", "output": "Confirmation bias affects decision making by causing people to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs while giving less consideration to alternative possibilities. This leads to selective perception, interpretation, and recall of information, resulting in skewed judgments and poor decisions."}
```

## Customization Points

When adapting this module's approach for your own implementations, consider these customization points:

1. **Template Design**: Create instruction templates appropriate for your specific domain
2. **Data Processing**: Adapt the data transformation logic to your data structures
3. **Validation Rules**: Implement custom validation logic for your dataset requirements
4. **Output Format**: Modify the output format to match your fine-tuning framework

## Integration with Fine-Tuning

The JSONL files produced by this module are designed to work seamlessly with the `fine_tuning` module in this toolkit, providing a complete pipeline from data preparation to model fine-tuning.

## Limitations

As noted, this module is highly specialized for the current application under development and includes:

- Application-specific data structures
- Custom template designs for particular use cases
- Domain-specific validation rules
- Specialized augmentation strategies

While the code demonstrates implementation approaches, direct reuse in other projects would require significant adaptation.
