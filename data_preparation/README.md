# Data Preparation Module

## Overview

This module provides specialized tools for preprocessing and transforming raw data into formats suitable for language model fine-tuning. **This implementation is highly customized for a specific application workflow** and is provided primarily as a reference example rather than a general-purpose library.

## Purpose

The Data Preparation module focuses on:

1. Cleaning and normalizing text data from various sources
2. Transforming unstructured content into structured formats
3. Implementing application-specific data processing pipelines
4. Validating and ensuring data quality for fine-tuning tasks

## Workflow Example

The typical workflow involves:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Loading raw data from various sources
2. **Initial Cleaning**: Removing unwanted elements and normalizing text
3. **Content Extraction**: Identifying and extracting relevant content
4. **Segmentation**: Breaking content into appropriate sized chunks
5. **Transformation**: Converting to formats suitable for fine-tuning
6. **Validation**: Ensuring data quality meets requirements
7. **Export**: Saving processed data for use in the dataset_building module

## Integration with Fine-Tuning Pipeline

This module is designed to feed into the `dataset_building` and `fine_tuning` modules in this toolkit:

```
Raw Data → Data Preparation → Dataset Building → Fine-Tuning
```

## Customization Points

When adapting this module's approaches for your own implementations, consider:

1. **Source-Specific Processing**: Different data sources often require specific handling
2. **Domain-Specific Normalization**: Text normalization requirements vary by domain
3. **Chunk Size Optimization**: Finding the optimal text chunk size for your model
4. **Quality Filtering**: Implementing appropriate data quality checks

## Requirements

- Elixir 1.16 or higher
- File system access for reading input data and writing processed outputs
- Dependencies for specific data formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Pandoc for conversion of file types

## Limitations

As noted, this module is highly specialized for the current application under development and includes:

- Application-specific data transformation logic
- Custom normalization rules for particular text types
- Specialized segmentation strategies
- Domain-specific validation criteria

While the code demonstrates implementation approaches, direct reuse in other projects would require significant adaptation.
